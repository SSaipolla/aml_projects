APPLIED MACHINE LEARNING PROJECTS

Current repository consists different approaches of ML in solving problems, ranging from simple classification to complex one-shot classification based on pre-trained transformers.

Repository also consists final project, where implemented a new classification model for rmp dataset based on transformer
